### VM Prerequisites

Before running any virtual machines, make sure your system is properly configured:

Step 1: Enable Virtualization in BIOS
Ensure that the Virtualization Technology (VT-x/AMD-V) is enabled in your system's BIOS settings.

Step 2: Disable Conflicting Windows Features
Disable the following Windows features to prevent conflicts with VirtualBox and Vagrant:

Windows Subsystem for Linux
Virtual Machine Platform
Windows Hypervisor Platform
Docker Desktop
To disable these features:

Go to Control Panel > Programs > Turn Windows Features on or off.
Uncheck the boxes for the above features and click OK.

Now youâ€™re all set to proceed with setting up your virtual machines and work on your DevOps project!
